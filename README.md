Homework description:

Follow the instructions on the IA Fablab 2014 Fall Laser Materials Settings repository to turn in your material testing results.
Design a simple form to cut/engrave on the laser using your own materials.
"Simple" meaning something you can cut out of a single sheet of a material of your choice no larger than 18"x12".
You should use Illustrator (start with the template!) to create your design.

My object description
I made five icons of Bolton Hill community. I did some research on different buildings and took some photos of architectures in Bolton Hill. After that, I drew a couple of images to find out the elements of the architecture features. My icons included the old style buildings, church and modern architecture such as MICA Brown Center. I want to use laser-cutting technique to make those icons become 3D objects that could sell and be useful. Thus, I cut some holes that are supposed to hang on the key rings or dog chains. I use two colors, black and red for the lines in Illustrator.  The black lines are supposed to like a line drawing, and the red lines are supposed to cut off. My material is plywood. I thought it should be a great material to show the historic feeling of Bolton Hill.

The laser settings (speed, power, frequency)
red   speed:100, power:75
black speed:100, power:10
